#SaveSpace (Front-End)

A web application made to rate and review a location based on their inclusivity for women, people of color and the LGBTQ community.

## About & History

Have you ever felt uncomfortable or like you didn't belong at a certain establishment based on your gender, race or sexuality?
SaveSpace was created with those experiences in mind.
First created at Technica 2017, Redone in 2019.

Created with a Ruby on Rails [Backend](https://github.com/aariasgonz21/SaveSpace-backend), scraping establishment data using the Yelp Fusion API in the backend, using React to create separate components for each page & functionality (Reviews, Ratings, Search, Establishment Pages, etc.), and Custom CSS + Semantic UI for styling.

All ratings for a location are **averaged** based on all users ratings.
